# Differential-Equation-Plotting

This code was inspired by the Fall 2017 Math 125 Ordinary Differential Equations class at UC Merced. Special thanks to Professor Shilpa Khatri, as well as Ms. Shayna Bennett and Ms. Matea Alvarado, for teaching the class.

Much of the code was also inspired by the MATLAB code of the author of the textbook. The code can be found at:
